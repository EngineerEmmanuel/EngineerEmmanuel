Hi, I’m Ewenike Chukwuemeka Emmanuel, a passionate front-end developer who loves turning ideas into fast, responsive, and intuitive digital experiences.

I started my coding journey in 2022 and have grown into a developer who enjoys solving real problems through clean, scalable interfaces. My main focus is building products that feel smooth and simple for users while staying performant under the hood.

I work primarily with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and I enjoy exploring new technologies that push the web forward. Here, you’ll find some of my personal projects and open-source contributions that reflect my growth and curiosity.

I’m always open to learning, collaborating with other builders, and contributing to meaningful projects.
Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you’d like to connect or build something great together.
